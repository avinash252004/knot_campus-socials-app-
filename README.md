# 🚀 My React Native Project

This is a **React Native** application built with [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).
It serves as a foundation for building scalable, cross-platform mobile apps using **JavaScript/TypeScript** and **React Native’s modern architecture**.

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

> **Note:** Before continuing, ensure you’ve completed the official [React Native Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) up to the **"Creating a new application"** step.

---

### 📦 Step 1: Start the Metro Bundler

Metro is the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native.

Run this command from your project’s **root directory**:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

---

### 📱 Step 2: Launch the App

With Metro running, open a new terminal in the project root and run:

#### For Android

```bash
npm run android
# OR
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
npm run ios
# OR
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, your app should launch in the **Android Emulator** or **iOS Simulator** 🎉
You can also open the project directly in **Android Studio** or **Xcode**.

---

### 🧩 Step 3: Modify and Reload

Once the app is running, you can start customizing it!

1. Open the `App.tsx` file in your preferred editor.
2. Make some changes.
3. Reload the app to see your updates:

   * **Android:** Press <kbd>R</kbd> twice or use **Ctrl + M** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd ⌘ + M** (macOS) → Select **Reload**
   * **iOS:** Press <kbd>Cmd ⌘ + R</kbd> in the Simulator

---

## 🎉 Congratulations!

You’ve successfully built and launched your **React Native app**! 🥳
